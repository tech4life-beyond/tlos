# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## Contributor Level System

---

## 1. Purpose of the Level System

The Contributor Level System exists to:
- Enable participation without hierarchy
- Protect ethical coherence
- Match access with responsibility
- Support personal and collective growth

Levels are **not ranks**. They do not grant power over others.

Levels define **access, responsibility, and scope of contribution**.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- No level is superior to another
- Every level serves the system
- Movement between levels is fluid and voluntary
- No participant is locked into a role
- Responsibility increases with access

---

## 3. Level Overview

The system is composed of four participation levels:

1. Observer
2. Contributor
3. Creator
4. Architect

Each level is defined by:
- Access
- Responsibilities
- Requirements
- Scope of impact

## 8. Movement Between Levels

Participants may move between levels:
- Upward through contribution and alignment
- Downward by choice or life circumstance

Movement is never punitive.

---

## 9. Exit and Autonomy

Participation in Tech4Life & Beyond is voluntary.

Any participant may leave at any time.

Contributions already made remain protected under TOIL.

---

## 10. Living System

This level system evolves with experience.

Any changes must:
- Preserve horizontal leadership
- Avoid hierarchy
- Protect human dignity

---

**Access grows with responsibility.
Responsibility grows with consciousness.**
