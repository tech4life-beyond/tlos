# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## BLOCK 7 — Product Factory

---

## 1. Purpose

The Tech4Life Product Factory defines the **standardized, repeatable, and ethical process** by which ideas become licensable products under the TOIL framework.
Products are licensed under the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL).

This system ensures that:
- Innovation is scalable
- Quality is consistent
- Ethics are enforced
- Contributors are protected

The Product Factory is the **engine** of Tech4Life & Beyond.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> No idea becomes a product by force.
> Every product earns its right to exist.

Creation follows responsibility, not ambition.

---

## 3. Entry Point — Idea Submission

### Who Can Submit
- Contributors (all levels)
- Creators
- Architects

Observers may propose ideas through sponsored contributors.

### Idea Intake Format
Every idea must include:
- Problem statement (real-world impact)
- Intended beneficiary (human, animal, planet)
- Non-harm declaration
- Initial feasibility note

Ideas without clear benefit are rejected.

---

## 4. Ethical Gate (Mandatory)

Before any technical work:

Each idea passes an **Ethical Gate Review**:
- Does it harm life?
- Does it exploit addiction, fear, or dependency?
- Does it damage ecosystems?
- Can it be misused for harm?

If risk exists:
- Mitigation must be designed
- Or the idea is terminated

No exceptions.

---

## 5. Team Formation

Once approved:

- A temporary **Product Cell** is formed
- Size: 3–7 contributors
- Roles emerge organically (no fixed hierarchy)

One member acts as **Product Steward** (not a boss).

---

## 6. Product Cell Responsibilities

The Product Cell owns:
- Design
- Documentation
- Ethical compliance
- Maintenance

Ownership is **collective**, authorship is **credited individually**.

---

## 7. Standard Product Pipeline (Canonical)

**Canonical lifecycle:** the **9-stage Product Creation Pipeline** defined in
[`docs/product-pipeline/Product_Creation_Pipeline.md`](../product-pipeline/Product_Creation_Pipeline.md).

Every product follows the same 9 stages:

1. Idea Submission  
2. Ethical Pre-Evaluation  
3. Concept Definition  
4. Team Formation  
5. Design & Prototyping  
6. Validation & Documentation  
7. TOIL Registration  
8. Licensing Preparation  
9. Post-Release Stewardship  

**Rule:** skipping stages is not allowed. If a product needs a different flow, it must be defined as a **Factory Profile** that still maps to these stages (with an ADR and documented rationale).

## 8. Required Documentation (TOIL Product Pack)

Before release, the following must exist:

- TOIL Registration Record
- Technical Summary
- Ethical Compliance Statement
- Sell Sheet (1 page)
- Licensing Disclaimer

Optional:
- Pitch Deck
- Prototype files

---

## 9. GitHub Integration

All products are tracked in GitHub:

- Dedicated folder per product
- Versioned documentation
- Timestamped commits

GitHub acts as:
- Public prior-art record (where applicable)
- Collaboration hub
- Transparency layer

---

## 10. Kill Switch (Critical)

At any stage, a product can be:
- Paused
- Reworked
- Terminated

Triggers include:
- Ethical violation
- Safety concerns
- Loss of purpose alignment

Stopping a product is considered a success if harm is prevented.

---

## 11. Licensing Readiness

A product is considered **Licensable** when:

- Documentation is complete
- Ethics review is passed
- TOIL registration is published
- No unresolved risks remain

Only then may it be presented to manufacturers.

---

## 12. Royalty Eligibility

Royalty distribution applies only if:
- Product is licensed commercially
- Contributors signed Collaboration Agreement

Royalties are tied to:
- Contribution
- Responsibility
- Ongoing stewardship

---

## 13. Living System

The Product Factory evolves.

Changes must:
- Be documented
- Preserve ethical gates
- Maintain contributor protection

---

**We do not mass-produce products.
We cultivate meaningful innovations.**
