# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## Block 7: Product Factory (Implementation Profile)

---

## 1. Purpose

The Tech4Life Product Factory defines the **standardized, repeatable, and ethical operating model** by which ideas become licensable products under the TOIL framework.

**Canonical lifecycle authority:** The Product Factory operates using the **9-stage Product Creation Pipeline** defined in:
- `docs/product-pipeline/Product_Creation_Pipeline.md` (PCL — canonical)

This Factory document is an **implementation profile**: it explains *how* we execute the lifecycle without redefining it.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> No idea becomes a product by force.
> Every product earns its right to exist.

Creation follows responsibility, not ambition.

---

## 3. Entry Point — Idea Submission

### Who Can Submit
- Contributors
- Creators
- Architects

Observers may propose ideas through sponsored contributors.

### Idea Intake Format
Every idea must include:
- Problem statement (real-world impact)
- Intended beneficiary (human, animal, planet)
- Non-harm declaration
- Initial feasibility note

Ideas without clear benefit are rejected.

---

## 4. Ethical Gate (Mandatory)

Before any technical work:

Each idea passes an **Ethical Gate Review**:
- Does it harm life?
- Does it exploit addiction, fear, or dependency?
- Does it damage ecosystems?
- Can it be misused for harm?

If risk exists:
- Mitigation must be designed
- Or the idea is terminated

No exceptions.

---

## 5. Team Formation

Once approved:

- A temporary **Product Cell** is formed
- Size: 3–7 contributors
- Roles emerge organically (no fixed hierarchy)

One member acts as **Product Steward** (not a boss).

---

## 6. Product Cell Responsibilities

The Product Cell owns:
- Design
- Documentation
- Ethical compliance
- Maintenance

Ownership is **collective**, authorship is **credited individually**.

---

## 7. Factory Execution Profile (Maps to Canonical Pipeline)

This section maps how the factory *executes* the canonical pipeline stages (PCL).
It does **not** replace or redefine the pipeline.

- Stages 1–3: Intake + ethics + concept hardening
- Stage 4: Cell formation + stewardship assignment
- Stages 5–6: Build + validate + document
- Stage 7: TOIL registration package completion
- Stage 8: Licensing prep package generation
- Stage 9: Stewardship loop (monitoring + remediation)

---

## 8. Required Documentation (TOIL Product Pack)

Before release, the following must exist:

- TOIL Registration Record
- Technical Summary
- Ethical Compliance Statement
- Licensing Readiness Documentation

Optional:
- Sell Sheet
- Pitch Deck
- Prototype status
- Royalty model

---

## 9. GitHub Integration

All products are tracked in GitHub:

- Dedicated folder per product
- Versioned documentation
- Timestamped commits

GitHub acts as:
- Public prior-art record (where applicable)
- Collaboration hub
- Transparency layer

---

## 10. Kill Switch (Critical)

At any stage, a product can be:
- Paused
- Reworked
- Terminated

Triggers include:
- Ethical violation
- Safety concerns
- Loss of purpose alignment

Stopping a product is considered a success if harm is prevented.

---

## 11. Licensing Readiness

A product is considered **Licensable** when:

- Documentation is complete
- Ethics review is passed
- TOIL registration is published
- No unresolved risks remain

Only then may it be presented to manufacturers.

---

## 12. Royalty Eligibility

Royalty distribution applies only if:
- Product is licensed commercially
- Contributors signed Collaboration Agreement (or equivalent governance-approved instrument)

Royalties are tied to:
- Contribution
- Responsibility
- Ongoing stewardship

---

## 13. Living System

The Product Factory evolves.

Changes must:
- Be documented
- Preserve ethical gates
- Maintain contributor protection

---

**We do not mass-produce products.
We cultivate meaningful innovations.**
