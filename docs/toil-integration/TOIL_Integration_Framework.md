# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## TOIL Integration Framework

---

## 1. Purpose of TOIL

The Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) exists to protect creators, humanity, and the planet while enabling ethical use, collaboration, and commercialization.

TOIL is not a traditional open-source license.
It is an **ethical impact license** designed for real-world products, systems, and technologies.

TOIL ensures that:
- Creations remain aligned with ethical intent
- Creators are protected and credited
- Harmful or exploitative uses are restricted
- Commercial value is shared fairly

---

## 2. TOIL as a Core System Component

Within Tech4Life & Beyond, TOIL is not optional.

Every product created through the Product Creation Pipeline must be registered under TOIL before release.

TOIL acts as:
- Legal framework
- Ethical safeguard
- Value distribution mechanism
- Trust layer between creators and users

---

## 3. Default Scope Rule (Canonical)

**Default rule:** Any asset created within Tech4Life & Beyond is governed by TOIL by default.

This includes:
- Physical products
- Digital products
- Designs and schematics
- Documentation
- Processes and systems

### 3.1 Exceptions (Allowed, but controlled)

An exception is allowed only if it is:
1. **Explicitly documented** (scope + reason)
2. **Approved under governance procedure**
3. **Recorded with effective date** and owner sign-off
4. **Traceable** (stored in GitHub with a permanent reference)

If no exception record exists, TOIL applies.

---

## 4. TOIL Registration Process

TOIL registration occurs after product validation and documentation.

Registration includes:
- Product description
- Intended use
- Ethical constraints
- Contributor attribution
- Commercial classification

Once registered, the product becomes an official Tech4Life creation.

---

## 5. Commercial vs Non-Commercial Use

### 5.1 Non-Commercial Use

Products classified as non-commercial:
- Are freely accessible to humanity
- May be used, modified, and shared
- Must retain attribution
- Must respect ethical constraints

Access is a right when no profit is involved.

---

### 5.2 Commercial Use

Products classified as commercial:
- Require a licensing agreement
- Generate royalties
- Must comply with TOIL ethical conditions

Commercial use without licensing is prohibited.

---

## 6. Royalty and Value Distribution

Royalties generated through TOIL-licensed products are distributed according to:
- Contribution level
- Role in creation
- Agreed royalty framework

Value distribution prioritizes:
- Creators
- System sustainability
- Impact reinvestment

No value extraction without contribution is permitted.

---

## 7. Protection Against Misuse

TOIL explicitly restricts uses that:
- Cause harm
- Enable exploitation
- Violate human rights
- Damage the environment

If misuse is detected:
- Licenses may be revoked
- Legal action may be pursued
- Public disclosure may occur

Ethics override commercial interest.

---

## 8. Relationship Between TOIL and External IP

TOIL may coexist with:
- Patents
- Trademarks
- Regulatory requirements

TOIL does not replace legal compliance.
It enhances ethical compliance.

---

## 9. Transparency and Trust

TOIL registrations are documented and traceable.

Transparency builds trust between:
- Creators
- Users
- Partners
- Humanity

---

## 10. Living License Framework

TOIL evolves with:
- Legal environments
- Technological change
- Ethical understanding

Any evolution must:
- Preserve creator protection
- Preserve public benefit
- Prevent exploitation

---

**TOIL exists to ensure that creation benefits life, not power.**
