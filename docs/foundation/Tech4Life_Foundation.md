# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## Foundation

---

## 1. Purpose

The Tech4Life Foundation defines the non-negotiable principles that govern all creation, collaboration, licensing, and stewardship within Tech4Life & Beyond.

This document is normative.

---

## 2. Core Premise

Creation is not neutral.

Every product, system, or invention either:
- contributes to life, dignity, and well-being
or
- contributes to harm, exploitation, or decay.

Tech4Life exists to build only what benefits life.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Principles

### 3.1 Life-Positive Creation
All Tech4Life creations must:
- protect human well-being
- protect animal well-being
- protect ecosystems and planetary health

### 3.2 Ethics Before Innovation
Ethical alignment is a mandatory gate before:
- development
- publication
- licensing
- commercialization

### 3.3 Documentation Before Execution
If it is not documented, it is not real.
Documentation is a protection mechanism against:
- drift
- exploitation
- hidden harm
- loss of accountability

### 3.4 Collaboration Without Extraction
No one may extract value from others without:
- consent
- credit
- fair value distribution
- responsibility for consequences

### 3.5 Stewardship Over Ownership
Ownership is not domination.
Stewardship means:
- caring for the work
- maintaining integrity
- responding to consequences
- protecting contributors

---

## 4. Harm Prohibition

Tech4Life prohibits creation that:
- intentionally harms humans
- intentionally harms animals
- intentionally damages the environment
- enables exploitation, manipulation, or coercion
- creates dependency through addiction, fear, or deception

If harm is discovered, the work must be paused and reviewed.

---

## 5. Transparency

Transparency is the default.

Exceptions are permitted only for:
- legal obligations
- personal privacy
- protection of sensitive control-plane artifacts

---

## 6. Responsibility After Release

Creation does not end at release.

Every product remains under stewardship:
- impact monitoring
- mitigation of unintended harm
- iterative improvement
- withdrawal if necessary

---

## 7. Living Foundation

This foundation evolves only through:
- documented rationale
- ethical review
- governance approval

The foundation must never evolve into permission for harm.
