# Tech4Life Operating System (TLOS)
## Product Creation Pipeline (Canonical Lifecycle)

---

## 1. Purpose

The Product Creation Pipeline defines how ideas are transformed into ethical, useful, and licensable products within Tech4Life & Beyond.

This pipeline exists to:
- Prevent chaotic creation
- Protect ethical integrity
- Enable collaboration without exploitation
- Ensure repeatability and scalability

No product exists within Tech4Life & Beyond unless it passes through this pipeline.

---

## 1.1 Authority and Precedence

If there is any conflict between lifecycle guidance in other documents and this document, **this Product Creation Pipeline prevails** for lifecycle interpretation and compliance.

Other documents MAY define implementation profiles, but they MUST map back to the canonical stages defined here.

---

## 2. Canonical Lifecycle Definition

This document defines the **canonical Product Creation Lifecycle (PCL)** consisting of **nine (9) stages**.

Any other TLOS document describing “factory steps” is an **implementation profile** and **must not redefine stages**.

---

## 3. Core Principles

- Ethics precede innovation
- Documentation precedes execution
- Collaboration precedes ownership
- Impact precedes profit

Speed is never prioritized over responsibility.

---

## 4. Pipeline Overview (9 Stages)

Every product follows the same lifecycle:

1. Idea Submission
2. Ethical Pre-Evaluation
3. Concept Definition
4. Team Formation
5. Design & Prototyping
6. Validation & Documentation
7. TOIL Registration
8. Licensing Preparation
9. Post-Release Stewardship

---

## 5. Stage 1 — Idea Submission

Any Creator or Contributor may submit an idea.

An idea submission must include:
- Problem statement
- Intended benefit
- Target users
- Potential risks

Ideas without clear purpose are not advanced.

---

## 6. Stage 2 — Ethical Pre-Evaluation

Before any technical work begins, the idea undergoes an ethical review.

This review evaluates:
- Human impact
- Environmental consequences
- Risk of misuse
- Alignment with the Foundation

If ethical concerns are unresolved, the idea is paused or rejected.

---

## 7. Stage 3 — Concept Definition

The idea is refined into a clear concept.

This includes:
- Scope definition
- Assumptions
- Constraints
- Success criteria

The output is a Concept Definition Document (CDD).

---

## 8. Stage 4 — Team Formation

A voluntary micro-team is formed around the concept.

Teams:
- Are self-organized
- Operate under horizontal leadership
- Share responsibility

No one is assigned to a team. Participation is voluntary.

---

## 9. Stage 5 — Design & Prototyping

The team designs and prototypes the product.

Requirements:
- Continuous documentation
- Ethical checkpoints
- Iterative feedback

Prototypes must demonstrate feasibility, not perfection.

---

## 10. Stage 6 — Validation & Documentation

The product is validated for:
- Functionality
- Safety
- Ethical alignment
- Usability

Complete documentation is mandatory.

A product without documentation cannot proceed.

---

## 11. Stage 7 — TOIL Registration

Once validated, the product is registered under the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL).

This defines:
- Usage rights
- Attribution
- Commercial conditions
- Protection against misuse

TOIL registration is required before any release.

---

## 12. Stage 8 — Licensing Preparation

If the product is commercial:
- Licensing packages are prepared
- Manufacturing or distribution guidelines are created
- Royalty frameworks are defined

If the product is non-commercial:
- It is released freely to humanity

---

## 13. Stage 9 — Post-Release Stewardship

After release, the product remains under stewardship.

This includes:
- Monitoring impact
- Addressing unintended consequences
- Iterating when necessary

Creation responsibility does not end at release.

---

## 14. Pipeline Integrity

Skipping stages is not permitted.

Any attempt to bypass the pipeline invalidates the product within Tech4Life & Beyond.

---

## 15. Living Pipeline

This pipeline evolves with experience.

All changes must:
- Preserve ethical primacy
- Maintain transparency
- Protect human and planetary well-being

---

**Creation is not an act.
It is a responsibility.**
