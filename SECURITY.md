# Security Policy

## Supported versions
TLOS is documentation-first doctrine. There is no runtime code here, but **security-relevant issues** can still exist:
- leaked secrets in history
- unsafe operational guidance
- vulnerable links to third-party resources
- governance gaps that could enable abuse

We treat these as security issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability or security concern

Please **do not** open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Use one of the following:
1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred), if enabled for this repository.
2. If advisories are not available: open an issue titled **"SECURITY (PRIVATE REQUEST)"** and include **no sensitive details**, then request a private channel with the repository owner.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Location (file path + section)
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation, if known

## Disclosure policy

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
- We will coordinate a fix and publish an appropriate disclosure note once resolved.
